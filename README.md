# document-indexer
Hey there. this app gonna be kinda simple:
- Simple `doc/docx/ppt/pptx/xls/xslx` upload form contains only the file upload
- Simple text search to search stuff inside the uploaded files.

## Things you can use
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) or any other server-side language you'd prefer. [Vert.x](http://vertx.io) will be great if you'd like to use Java and [Play!](http://playframework.com) is fine too
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) for indexing the text.
- [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/) with the `headless` flag for the conversions
- [React.js](http://reactjs.com) for the client side. plain HTML/JS/Server Rendered will be okay too.

## That's kinda it
Anything should be on this git repository. [you can learn how to git here](https://guides.github.com)
For any further assistance, you can use the great minds of @Corevo or @mkuts12 or just come by the office.

Good luck dude :smirk:
